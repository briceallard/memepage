### **Don't expect updates to this. This is a solution to my hard drive problem not a product.**

What's the solution?

1. Log in through a cute panel via google preferably.
1. Drag memes into a box just like Dropbox.
1. JavaScript takes over and thumbnails/uploads files to AWS bucket.
1. Bucket is used as a CDN through CloudFront -> CloudFlare.

## **Installation**

Nothing yet. Come back later.
